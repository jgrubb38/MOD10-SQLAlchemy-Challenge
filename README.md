## About
In this challenge, I've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I decided to do a climate analysis of the area.

## Summary
With the data provided, I analyzed the frequency of precipitation for a year. It shows a sporadic precipitation rate which isn't uncommon for a tropical climate. No patterns can be recognized from this chart. Although, there seems to be a trend in precipitation frequency to temperature. According to my analysis, the precipitation frequency is high between the temperatures 70° - 78° and the highest between the temperatures 73° - 77°, then drops at 82°+. I personally like the heat so I will use the Temperature vs Frequency chart to book my trip while it's 80°+ so I can avoid the rain.
